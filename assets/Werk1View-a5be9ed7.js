The objective was to glean inspiration from this beautiful city and channel that inspiration into a creative project of which we were free to choose to our liking. Collaborating with two of my friends, Medina and Anysa, we created a magazine that concluded quotes of interviews we took from people on the street, edited pictures of the interviewed people and drawings. </h2></div><div class="bg-2"></div><div class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 text-gray-800 dark:text-white font-sans" style="line-height:1.7;"><h2> In keeping with the city’s French-speaking context, our interviews were conducted in French, posing the fundamental question: “Pourquoi est-ce que vous aimez Liège?” (Why do you love Liège?). We wanted to understand why Liège is so imported to these people and maybe after, it would change our opinion about the city. At home, every one of us worked on the magazine, using their own unique creative input. I edited all the pictures, Anysa made the drawings and Medina made the Colophon for the book. </h2></div><div class="luikpadding dark:bg-gray-800"><img src="'+i+'" alt=""></div>',5);function n(s,r){return a}const h=e(o,[["render",n]]);export{h as default};
