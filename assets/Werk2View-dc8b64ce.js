Conducted on November 11, 2022, the project involved the concept of &quot;visual field recordings,&quot; drawing inspiration from the practice of field recording in sound art. Field recording refers to capturing ambient sounds in a given environment, commonly used as foundational material for creating musical compositions. In our adaptation of this method, we embarked on creating visual field recordings to encapsulate a specific time and place through graphic imagery. Each participant, myself included, crafted a 16-page booklet, with each page showcasing a unique graphic field recording. </div></h2></div></div></div><div class="bg-14"></div><div class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800"><h2 class="font-sans text-gray-800 dark:text-white" style="line-height:1.7;"><div class="flex justify-center center-items text-black"> Together, these booklets collectively form a larger graphic report documenting 11.11.22, serving as a unique database of diverse graphic ideas and methods. We were given the freedom to select various subjects for our photography project, and one option that intrigued me was capturing the &quot;footprints of living.&quot; For this specific subject, we were tasked with making photographs that reflected the habitation of humans or other organisms. I decided to add a unique twist by creating a horror-themed booklet, capturing eerie and unsettling images of places where people had passed by. </div></h2></div><div class="grid grid-cols-2"><img class="" src="'+i+'" alt=""><img class="" src="'+s+'" alt=""><img class="" src="'+a+'" alt=""><img class="" src="'+o+'" alt=""><img class="" src="'+r+'" alt=""><img class="" src="'+n+'" alt=""></div>',4);function l(g,p){return d}const f=e(c,[["render",l]]);export{f as default};
