One of this year&#39;s endeavors was with <a class="text-pink-600 font-bold animate-pulse" href="https://www.eigen-kweek.be">Eigen Kweek</a>, an organization that provides funding for recent college graduates with a bachelor&#39;s degree in theater. Their mission is to support these individuals in creating productions that can be showcased in Flanders. Annually, a selection is made from numerous diverse groups, choosing four groups representing four provinces: Flemish-Brabant, Antwerp, West-Flanders, and East-Flanders. </h2></div><div class="text-gray-800 dark:text-white font-sans" style="line-height:1.7;"><h2> While the organization had already enlisted a graphic designer for the logo and brand identity, they urgently required another designer to create eye-catching <a class="text-pink-600 font-bold animate-pulse" href="https://www.instagram.com/eigenkweek2023/">Instagram slides</a> to announce premiere dates and developing professional brochures tailored for prominent theater venues. This project demanded quick and effective design solutions, and I successfully delivered on time, ensuring impactful promotional materials for Eigen Kweek. </h2></div></div><div class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="padding"><div class="relative mx-auto border-gray-800 dark:border-gray-700 bg-gray-800 border-[14px] rounded-[2.5rem] h-[600px] w-[300px]"><div class="h-[64px] bg-gray-800 dark:bg-gray-800 absolute -end-[17px] top-[142px] rounded-e-lg"></div><div class="rounded-[2rem] overflow-hidden w-[272px] h-[572px] bg-white dark:bg-gray-800"><img src="'+a+'" class="dark:hidden w-[272px] h-[572px]" alt=""><img src="'+s+'" class="hidden dark:block w-[272px] h-[572px]" alt=""></div></div></div></div></div>',2);function n(d,o){return i}const c=e(r,[["render",n]]);export{c as default};
