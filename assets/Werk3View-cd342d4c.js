I was curious to know what RISO printing is and because I enrolled in a study field of Graphic Design, learning how to work with printing machines could come in very handful. </div><div class="mb-4"> We had to come up with a concept to print and I wanted to use pictures that I made while being on vacation. It is the piece of work I&#39;m most proud of that I made in my first year of studying at an art school, because we had all the freedom that we wanted to create something personal. </div><div> I incorporated the national fruit of the selected country. The aim was to create an effect where the colors come out beautifully while overlapping with each other, and I think I succeeded in that regard because it&#39;s inherently easier with RISO printing than with regular printing as every color needs to be printed seperatelly. </div></h2></div><div class="sm:grid grid-cols-2"><p class="pt-32" style="height:417px;width:320px;"><img class="max-w-xs border-white border-15 dark:border-gray-800" src="'+s+'" alt="Picture 2"></p><p class="pt-32" style="height:417px;width:320px;"><img class="max-w-xs border-white border-15 dark:border-gray-800" src="'+i+'" alt="Picture 3"></p><p class="pt-26" style="height:417px;width:320px;"><img class="max-w-xs border-white border-15 dark:border-gray-800" src="'+o+'" alt="Picture 4"></p><p class="pt-26" style="height:417px;width:320px;"><img class="max-w-xs border-white border-15 dark:border-gray-800" src="'+n+'" alt="Picture 5"></p><p class="pt-20" style="height:417px;width:320px;"><img class="max-w-xs border-white border-15 dark:border-gray-800" src="'+c+'" alt="Picture 6"></p><p class="pt-20" style="height:417px;width:320px;"><img class="max-w-xs border-white border-15 dark:border-gray-800" src="'+d+'" alt="Picture 7"></p></div></div><div class="pb-130"></div>',2),g=[h];function u(w,b){return e(),a("div",p,g)}const x=t(l,[["render",u]]);export{x as default};
